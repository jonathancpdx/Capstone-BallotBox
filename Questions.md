Nick's Questions
1. Are we taking the current project and adding on to it? As mentioned in the CASCADES page that this project is great to teach cybersecurity topics?.

2. Must there be a retrieve functionality in our version of the Smart Ballot Box?

3. You want us to use commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) hardware to rebuild this project. Is there a budget limit to what the final project should cost?

4. How do we generate our own ballots? Is there a real Ballot Making Device (BMD)?

5. Can we focus on rebuilding our own version that implement other ballot identifies besides the barcodes previously use?
